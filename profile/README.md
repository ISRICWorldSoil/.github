[ISRICâ€“World Soil Information](https://www.isric.org) is an independent science-based foundation with a mission to serve the international community as a custodian of global soil information. 
We support the development and use of soil information to address global challenges through capacity strengthening, awareness raising and direct cooperation with users and clients. 

This github organisation hosts a number of initiatives, such as source code of tools, documentation, ontologies, implementation examples, etc.

We welcome your contributions via git issues/discussions and pull requests.
